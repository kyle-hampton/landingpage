            <h3>Frostheave Fantasy Esports is a Philadelphia-based tech startup with the goal of bringing casual and competitive gamers together. With the Frostheave mobile application, we can bridge the gap between pro-circuit and casual gamers. Frostheave's application uses player data to make esports more accessible and exciting than ever before. As gamers play their favorite games online, they and their competitors leave behind a trail of trackable and scalable data. With this game data the sky is the limit. Frostheave will use player data to thrust gamers into fantasy leagues already adapted to their strengths and abilities. Admission to a league will include a fee, scaled to the leagues skill level. Once a league begins, a captain will be chosen to lead, play alongside, and communicate with their fellow fantasy players. Leagues will then be placed head-to-head in winner-take-all championships competing for the ultimate prize: a money pool, built from both teams starting donations. Frostheave will bring the competitive nature of esports to the team-based gameplay of fantasy sports, building a unique and community-driven competition where both gaming veterans and casual gamers can take their gaming to the next level.</h3>
